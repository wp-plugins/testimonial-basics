			<h1><a id="4">&nbsp;</a>Installation</h1>
			
			<p>Upload Testimonial Basics to the plugin directory (wp-content/plugins/testimonial-basics) of your 
				wordpress setup. Ensure all sub directories are maintained. Activate the plugin through the Wordpress 
				Admin panel under "Plugins".</p><br/>
			
			<p>Your opening screen will look like this :</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_1.JPG" alt="Opening Screen" title="Opening Screen" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>Click the Activate link and the plugin will activate. The screen changes to :</p><br/><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_2.JPG" alt="Activated Screen" title="Activated Screen" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>If you want to remove the plugin you must first <q>Deactivate</q> it then <q>Delete</q> it. When
				you <q>Deacivate</q> the plugin is not loaded into WordPress, but it is still there. When you 
				<q>Delete</q> it all files,options and database table are removed.</p>
				
			<h1><a id="5">&nbsp;</a>Administration Panel - Testimonial Basics</h1>
			
			<p>Click on <q>Testimonial Basics</q> and the Administration Panel for the plugin will load, as shown below :</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_3.JPG" alt="Admin Panel 1" title="Admin Panel 1" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The first thing to note is that there are three administration pages for Testimonial Basics. The first page is a 
				quick summary of how to set up your input form and how to display testimonials. The second section is the Options 
				that you have for your input forms, and for displaying your testimonials. The third page is where you go to manage 
				your testimonials.</p><br/>
				
			<p>So when you can't quite remember the scripts for setting up input forms or displaying your testimonials, save your 
				page come over here and copy them, that's what I do.</p><br/>
			
			<h1><a id="6">&nbsp;</a>Administration Panel - Edit Testimonials</h1>
			
			<p>I think it's best to start with "Edit Testimonials" so click that panel and you will see:</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_4.JPG" alt="Edit Testimonial Panel" title="Edit Testimonial Panel" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>This is where as an administrator you will manage your testimonials. You can can add or edit testimonials here.</p>
				
			<h4>Help</h4>
			
			<p>There is a drop down help section that provides a quick summary of how to use the "Edit Testimonials" Panel :</p><br/>

			<img src="images/tb_IMG_5.JPG" alt="Help Section" title="Help Section" /><br/><br/>
			
			<h4>Enter or Update a Testimonial</h4>
			
			<p>To add a testimonial, simply fill in the form and click <q>Save Testimonial</q> :</p><br/>
				<ol>
					<li>ID - every testimonial has a unique id. You can't edit this field.</li>
					<li>Order - When you display testimonials you can use <q>Order</q> as a way to ensure certain 
						testimonials are displayed first. Simply enter a number. Ordered displays are shown in descending
						order so your more favorite testimonials should have the highest number.</li>
					<li>Approved - must be checked or the testimonial will not be displayed.</li>
					<li>Author - Required, the name of the person who wrote the testimonial.</li>
					<li>Website - Optional, input the Author Website and a link will be included in the display. 
						Make sure you test the link...you don't want broken links on your site, it's bad for SEO.</li>
					<li>Location - Optional, the location of the person who wrote the testimonial.</li>
					<li>Date - If left blank on new testimonials the current date and time will be used.</li>
					<li>Time - If left blank with a date set, the time is set to 00:00:00.</li>
					<li>Testimonial - Required, enter the testimonial here.</li>
				</ol><br/>
				
			<p>Once the <q>Save Testimonial</q> is clicked the testimonial is checked for validation, and then it is saved in the 
				database. The form refreshes to include the saved testimonial. If you want to change something you can do it now, 
				or later if you want. Below is the screen with a couple of testimonials added.</p><br/>

			<img src="images/tb_IMG_6.JPG" alt="Testimonials Added" title="Testimonials Added" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>To edit a testimonial click the button under the ID column for the testimonial you want to edit and it will come 
				up in the edit screen. Make your changes and <q>Save Testimonial</q>. It is that simple. 
			</p><br/>
			
			<p><em>Note: If you have a cache plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, the page you use to 
				display your testimonials may be cached. What this means is that if you add and approve a testimonial 
				it may not immediately display. Simply edit the page and update it or wait and the cached files will 
				eventually be deleted and refreshed.</em></p><br>
			
			<h1><a id="7">&nbsp;</a>Visitor Input Form</h1>
			
			<p>You can set up a visitor input form very easily. Simply include <code>&#60;!-- katb_input_form --&#62;</code> or 
				<code>&#60;p&#62;&#60;!-- katb_input_form --&#62;&#60;/p&#62;</code> in your page content. <em><br/>Note : 1) Make sure you 
					include a space between - k and m - or it won't work, 2) Make sure you are in HTML edit mode or it won't work.</em> Below 
					is an example of a page set-up.</p><br/>
					
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_7.JPG" alt="Set Up Vistor Input Form" title="Set Up Visitor Input Form" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>You can also use a widget as a user input form. Go to <q>Appearance</q> and then <q>Widgets</q> and drag the widget 
				to the widgetized area. You can also enter a different title for the Widget if you want.</p><br/>
				
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_8.JPG" alt="Input Widget" title="Input Widget" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The image below shows the forms as the Visitor would see them. Both the main content form and the widget form are 
				shown. In reality you probably should use one or the other. Visitors are required to enter an e-mail address, which is not saved. 
				The Blog Administrator for your site are sent an e-mail about the testimonial. Once validation is OK, the testimonial is saved in the 
				database. However it is saved as not approved so it is not displayed until you have a chance to log-in, edit if appropriate, 
				and approve.</p><br/>
				
			<p>Also note the captcha. This is an option in Testimonial Basics. There are a few other options for the input forms. I'll discuss them later.</p><br/><br/>
				
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_9.JPG" alt="Input Widget" title="Input Widget" /><br/><br/>
				
			<h1><a id="8">&nbsp;</a>Displaying Testimonials</h1>
			
			<p>You can display testimonials in the content of a page using a shortcode and you can also use a widget to display single testimonials.</p>
			
			<h4>Shortcode</h4>
			
			<p>To display testimonials create a new page and enter the following shortcode : <br/><br/>
				<code>[katb_testimonial by="date" number="all" id=""]</code></p><br/>

				<ol>
					<li>Options for "by" : "order" - display highest to lowest,"date"- display most recent first</li>
					<li>Options for "number" : "all" - displays all testimonials, or put in the number of testimonials you want to display</li>
					<li>Options for "id" : "" - leave blank for multiple testimonials, "ID" - put in testimonial ID, "random" - single random testimonial</li>
				</ol>
			<br/>
			<p><em>Note that if you put id="3" for example or id="random", then the <q>by</q> and <q>number</q> attributes are ignored.</em> The image below shows the set up.</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_10.JPG" alt="Display Testimonial Page Setup" title="Display Testimonial Page Setup" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>An example of the display is shown below. The testimonials are displayed in a simple format, allowing your themes colors and fonts to be used. You can 
				also select a formatted option that can be customized, see the "Administration Panel-Options" section below.</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_11.JPG" alt="Display Testimonial Example" title="Display Testimonial Example" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>When you have quite a few testimonials the display options can help you out. In particular displaying by="order" gives 
				you great flexibility. Just remember that the highest order number is displayed first. Another thing to remember is that if 
				you display more testimonials than you have numbered, that's OK. The remaining testimonials will be un-ordered testimonials, 
				displayed by most recent date.</p><br/>
				
			<p> One final note : There is no pagination in Testimonial Basics, you can display all your testimonials or a selection on one page. 
				I did not feel there was a need to put in pagination as visitors will likely not want to read more than one page of testimonials. 
				So put the best ones first, and I'd recommend displaying no more that 10 on a page. However you can display them all if you want. If 
				there is demand I can include pagination an a future release.</p>
			
			<h4>Testimonial Display Widget</h4>
			
			<p>You can also us a widget to display a testimonial. The widget will display a selected testimonial or can randomly pick a testimonial to 
				display when a page reloads. You can input a title and the ID number of the testimonial you want to display or <q>random</q> to display 
				a random testimonial from the approved list.</p><br/>
				
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_12.JPG" alt="Display Widget Setup" title="Display Widget Setup" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The image below shows the page with both the regular display and the widget display: </p><br/>
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_13.JPG" alt="Display Widget" title="Display Widget" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The color scheme has been changed to show that the displays use the native colors and fonts.</p>
			
			<h1><a id="9">&nbsp;</a>Administration Panel - Options</h1>
			
			<p>In the initial release of Testimonial Basics I showed the user how to go into the css file and change background colors, font colors and fonts. 
				One of the problems with that method is that the edits are lost after an update. This is not too big a deal as there are not a lot of edits, but 
				never the less they are a pain. Also the user must be quite careful when doing CSS edits or problems can occur. <em> Now all these changes can be 
				made in the options panel, where data entry is much easier.</em></p><br/>
				
			<p>Start by clicking on "Testimonial Basics" => "Options". The Testimonial Basics Options panel will appear. The screen shot below shows the panel with the 
				"Help" button clicked. A quick summary of using the Options panel is presented.</p><br/>
				
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_14.JPG" alt="Options Panel Help" title="Options Panel Help" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The next screenshot shows the options panel. It is divided up into three sections :</p><br/>
			
			<ol>
				<li>Input Form Options</li>
				<li>Testimonial Display Options</li>
				<li>Widget Testimonial Display Options</li>
			</ol>
			<br/>
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_15.JPG" alt="Testimonial Basics Options Panel" title="Testimonial Basics Options Panel" /><br/><br/>
				
			<h4>Input Form Options</h4>
			
			<p> The options for this section are :</p><br/>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Use captcha on input forms - Include a captcha in the input by selecting the "Use captcha on input forms" checkbox. 
					If for any reason the Captcha is not working, disable it here.</li>
				<li>Include title on input form - This gives you the flexibility of displaying an input form title. 
					It only applies to the content input form as the Display Widget has it's own title control.</li>
				<li>Title for Input Form - If you don't like the default title change it here.</li>
				<li>Include email not kept note - Check this box to include an email note. It is displayed on the content input form 
					and the widget input form. Typically these kind of input forms include a "Emails are not kept" note so you can 
					check this box and leave the default message.</li>
				<li>Email note - If you don't like the email note you can input your own message here. Also keep in mind that really 
					this is just a second line of text. For example, you may want to use "I'd love to hear from you!"</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>The screenshot below shows the input forms with these options enabled :</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_16.JPG" alt="Example Input Form Options Enabled" title="Example Input Form Options Enabled" /><br/><br/>
			
			<h4>Display Options</h4>
			
			<p>The "Testimonial Display Options" and "Widget Testimonial Display Options" sections are very similar so I'll address them together. The first part 
				allows the user to select what is displayed in the testimonial author strip : </p><br/>
				
			<ul>
				<li>Show website in testimonial - Click this box to display the website link. I'd recommend this for the content display but not for the widget display.</li>
				<li>Show date in testimonial - Click this box to display the date in the author strip.</li>
				<li>Show location in testimonial - Click this box to display the location in the author strip.</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>In a display Widget, you may only want to display the Author, and leave these options un-checked. Play around and decide what's best for your site.</p><br/>
			
			<p>Below is a screenshot with all three boxes checked for both the content and the widget displays. I've also checked the "Use formatted display" box for 
				each display, as an introduction to the next section.</p><br/>
				
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_17.JPG" alt="Testimonial Basics Display 1" title="Testimonial Basics Display 1" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>When you initially select a custom formatted display a default set of colors and fonts is loaded. The displays are pretty cool 
				but if your theme has different colors like this one, some adjustments are necessary. With the new theme options panel, it is very 
				easy to do.</p><br/>
			
			<h4>Changing Fonts</h4>
			
			<p>Select a font from the drop down list and click "Save Options".</p><br/>

			<p>They look like :</p>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_18.JPG" alt="Web Fonts" title="Web Fonts" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>To illustrate I'll change to Cambria for the main display and Trebuchet for the widget display.</p>
			
			<h4>Changing Colors - Using the Color Wheel</h4>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Select the cell of the color you want to change</li>
				<li>Select the middle of the square box</li>
				<li>Selest the dot on the circle and drag it around to set the basic color</li>
				<li>Select the dot in the square box and drag it to set the saturation</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p>You could also enter a hex color number :</p><br/>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Hex Color Codes are a 6 character designation preceded by the # sign. You can use the numbers 0 to 9, and A,a,B,b,C,c,D,d,E,e,F,f. So the following 
					are all valid colors : #000000(black),#0000FF(blue),#FAEBD7(AntiqueWhite). The following sites are great color references :
					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_colornames.asp">Color Names Supported by all Browsers</a> and 
					<a href="http://html-color-codes.info/">Html Color Codes</a></li>
				<li>Another great tool is the ColorZilla add on to Firefox Mozilla. It has a color picker that lets you pick colors on your 
					website, great for color matching. </li>
			</ul>
			<br/>
			<p><em>Make sure you save your options by clicking the "Save Options" button.</em></p>
			
			<br/>
			<p>I've gone ahead and put in the colors for the new theme. The edited panel is shown below. Note that normally 
				you would put a Testimoial Display Widget in one spot or the other making it easier to custon design the colors. 
				I have attempted to pick colors that fit in both areas</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_19.JPG" alt="Options Example" title="Options Example" /><br/><br/>
			
			<p>The results of the edit are shown below :</p><br/>
			
			<img src="images/tb_IMG_20.JPG" alt="Testimonial Basics Display 2" title="Testimonial Basics Display 2" /><br/><br/>			
		
			<h1><a id="10">&nbsp;</a>Advanced Function</h1>
			
			<p>I have developed a function that can be used in the coding of templates for displaying testimonials. It can come in handy when 
				you want to display testimonials from within the code and not in the content of the page. An example of such an application 
				would be in a preformatted page where there is a section you want to replace. Such was the case with one of the websites I look after, 
				which was why I developed the function. Below is an example of how to use the function :<br/><br/>
				
				<code>&#60;div class="testimonialstext"&#62;<br/>
						&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#60;?php echo katb_testimonial_basics_display_in_code('date','20','random'); ?&#62;<br/>
					&#60;/div&#62;</code><br/><br/>
					
				The first element must be "date" or "order", the second must be "all" or the number of testimonials you want to display 
				and the third element can be "random" or "id" where id is the id number of the testimonial, or "" blank if you 
				want to display multiple testimonials.<br/><br/>
				
				A string is returned for each testimonial to be displayed that will look as follows :<br/><br/>
				
				<code>&#60;p class="katb_p_test"&#62;Your Testimonial&#60;/p&#62;<br/>
					&#60;p class="katb_p_authorstrip"&#62;&#60;b&#62;Author&#60;/b&#62;date(optional),location(optional),website(optional)&#60;/p&#62;
				</code><br/><br/>
				
				The only formatting applied is to bold the author. You can apply your own custom formatting using the classes I have 
				included in the return string. Such a thing would best be done by creating a child theme 
				(<a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes">WordPress Child Themes</a>)
			</p>
			
			<h1><a id="11">&nbsp;</a>Summary</h1>
			
			<p>I hope you enjoy using the plugin, if you have any suggestions or comments, contact me through my website. If you really like the plugin, 
				buy me a coffee, a beer, or even a bottle of wine.</p><br/><br/>
