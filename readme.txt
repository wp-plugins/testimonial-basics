== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I just downloaded version 2.0.0 and I lost all my formatting =

When you first update testimonial basics you will default to the unformatted 
display option. Go to the options panel and there you will see a set of easy 
to use options. The option "Use formatted display" is the one to check. It will 
bring back the formatted display from the original version. Except now you can 
easily control the colors and fonts of the display, allowing you to taylor it to 
your theme.

= My testimonial is not showing? =

Ensure it is approved.

= I just approved a testimonial and it is nor showing? =

If you have a cache plugin installed such as WP Super Cache, the page you use to 
display your testimonials may be cached. Simply edit the page and update it or wait 
and the cached files will eventually be deleted and refreshed.

= When I input a color number in the cell the color won't change? =

Hit the enter key

= The color wheel is not working =

Some times to get the color wheel to work you need to click the center of the square box. 
Then you can drag the dot around thw circle to select the base color.
