Testimonial Basics Plugin - Translation Ready
==============================================

1) I believe the plug in is ready for translation.
2) I have included  testiminial-basics.pot which you can load into Poedit to do your translation.
3) As part of setting up the plugin for translation, I worked through a French Translation, not an 
   ideal solution but practical from a testing perspective. Stephane Lariviere from Quebec Canada 
   was kind enough to do a proper translation of the 2.10.6 version. The new version 3.0.0 has quite 
   a few more lines so I made an initial run for the new content, again using Google translate. So the 
   plugin is only partially properly translated to french. Thankyou Stephanie.
4) For anyone who goes through the trouble to translate the plugin to a different language, send me the 
   .po files and I will add the translation to the next release.
